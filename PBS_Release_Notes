PBS Release Notes
v126
Small bug fixing when Zeroing from a 0 distance
Document How to create a Zip file with all, see HowToPrepareAndUseA_PBS_zip-v126.pdf
v125
Improve documentation, Conclusion : accuracy is better using real atmo and PBS output rather than ICAO and Abacus.
v124
Muzzle speed in standard atmo added to the amo.csv file and used for MACH calculation.
v123
minor bug fixed regarding BC_G1 when BC:G7 is used
v122
Code Cleaning
v121
bugs fixed in zeroing process and Windage output.
v120
bugs fixed
v119
Runge Kutta coefficients calculus modified
v118
Small improvements and bugs fixed
v117
Improved Speed for Zeroing
A Windage offset has been added for zeroing (mainly to take into account the Spin Drift effect)
Coriolis effect formula aligned to Georj Klimi simplification proposal
v116
Option to generate Abacus (Elevation and Windage) or a Shooting Card.
For Abascus example see : Abacus-308_GGG_175.pdf
For Shhoting Card example see : ShootingCard-308_GGG_175_900_2024-09-18.pdf
